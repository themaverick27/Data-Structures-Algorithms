/*
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Note: You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (target > nums[mid]) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
